# Clean Home Screen
iOS jailbreak tweak that de-clutters SpringBoard

You can check it out [here](https://repo.dynastic.co/package/xyz.royalapps.cleanhomescreen).

# General Information
Clean Home Screen is available for free on Cydia, through the Dynastic Repo. To use it, add the source https://repo.dynastic.co on the Sources tab in Cydia, or use the "Add To Cydia" link provided on the [tweak page](https://repo.dynastic.co/package/xyz.royalapps.cleanhomescreen).

If you use either the Unc0ver or Electra jailbreaks (or possibly newer ones that haven't been released as of this writing), Dynastic Repo is a default source, so you don't need to add it manually.

Clean Home Screen has many options, allowing you to enable and disable the hiding of specific iOS elements from its preference 
panel in the Settings app.
